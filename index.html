					<td>The national costume of the Philippines, the baro’t saya, is an elegant hybrid of Filipino and Spanish clothing styles. The term itself comes from the Tagalog words "baro at saya" or "blouse and skirt," still the basic components of the ensemble. Made of pineapple cloth, the indigenous textile of the Philippine Islands, the silhouette of the garment relates to traditional Spanish costume, particularly in the cut of the sleeves, the shawl collar and trailing skirt.</td>
					<td>During the period of Spanish colonization, the baro't saya was the everyday dress of most Philippine women. Although everyday ensembles were far less ornate, the blouse component was usually more decorative than the skirt.</td>

					<td>Worn up to this day on very important celebrations and formal gatherings, the barong tagalog’s ever-present magnificence that is inherently Filipino has stood the test of time. Barong tagalog, root word baro pertaining to “upper garment”, literally means “Tagalog outfit”.</td>
					<td>A common theory on the origin of the barong is that the Spaniards could distinguish the indigenous Filipinos from the ruling classes by wearing the barong without the pants tucked in. Common in the Barong, it is made of thin cloth for the reason that the Spaniards can easily see those who wear it without carrying a weapon.</td>

					<td>Alampay is a traditional Filipino wrap or shoulder cloth worn by both men and women. It is typically made from handwoven fabric and used as an accessory to enhance traditional attire. Alampay adds flair and cultural significance to the overall outfit.</td>
					<td>The alampay became a symbol of Filipino identity and pride, representing the resilience of the Filipino people through centuries of colonization. In modern times, the alampay has evolved further, with contemporary designers reinterpreting it in various ways.</td>

				<tr class="table">
					<td><img src="https://philippinefolklifemuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/Evolution-of-Costume-15-Trajedemestiza-tulle-tapis.jpg"><br /> Tapis</td>
					<td>It is strikingly akin to most basic female garments in the Southeast Asian world, and seems somehow related to the Indian sari. The Filipino wrap-around skirt called tapis or patadyong my have emerged from environmental conditions and technical repertoires similar to those that produced the sarong and the sari.</td>
					<td>Having a similar function to woven fabrics in general, which is to protect the body, tapis also functions as jewelry, a symbol of purity, religious ceremonial equipment, and a symbol of one's social status.</td>

					<td>Manila shawls are square pieces of silk embroidered in chinoiserie-style motifs. The shawls were folded in half like a triangle and worn over the shoulders. These were carried over into the Spanish colonial period and acquired European design motifs like floral embroidery (using techniques like calado, sombrado, and deshilado).</td>
					<td>It is also used as a flag on balconies during various festivals. Manila shawls have also become an essential part of the flamenco dance costume. They were also used inside houses, and often placed over pianos – so often that were sometimes known as piano shawls.</td>
